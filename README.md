This program is a visual representaion of sorting using a few different sorting algorithms.

The Vasey sort one and two was engineered by Zachary Vasey. The first is similar to insertion sort. The second is similar to selection sort.

The Merge sort was written by Vangelis Metsis, Zachary Vasey applied the graphical aspect.

There are some graphical glitches that come along with using graphics while multithreading. Merge sort will experience these minor glitches.

# LEGEND:
	# START: 				The start button runs the current sort with the current list.
	# RESET: 				The reset button resets the list by giving the list elements new random values. NOTE: If the list is being sorted and the reset button is pressed, the delay is set to zero as to finsh	the sorting ASAP. Press reset once more after it is done sorting to get new random data.
	# DELAY: 				The DELAY text box is used to set the time inbetween comparisons in milisecond.
	# SORT DROP LIST: 		Picks the type of sort.
	# NUMBER OF ELEMENTS DROP LIST: 	Sets the amount of bars to be sorted. This resets the list as well.
# COLORS:
	# YELLOW:		The bar height is being compared to either another bar height of a value.
	# MAGENTA: 	The bar is being swapped with another bar.
	# GREEN: 		This bar is being set equal to another bar.
	# CYAN: 		This bar has been put into a temparary array.
